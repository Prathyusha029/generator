**Password Generator**
How It Works:
🔐 Users can define password criteria, including:
->Desired length of the password
->Inclusion of letters, numbers, and symbols
->Fully customizable to ensure flexibility and security

⚙️ Once the criteria are provided, the tool generates a random, secure password based on the user’s preferences.

string for accessing character sets like letters, digits, and symbols.
->User Input Handling:
Interactive prompts to gather user preferences for password generation.
->Logic:
Conditional checks to validate user input and ensure at least one character type is selected.
